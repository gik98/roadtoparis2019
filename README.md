## C - Duty Scheduler

[Problem on Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems/dutyscheduler)

[See solution](dutyscheduler.cpp)

### Problem discussion

This is a classical assignment problem which could be solved using flow networks. Modeling could be done as described below.

We have a vertex for every student, a vertex for every day, the sink vertex and the source vertex.
Connect the source to every student-vertex with edges of capacity *x* (*x* is the maximum number of days on which any RA is assigned).
Connect a student-vertex to the day-vertex *d* with an edge of capacity 1 if the student is available to fulfill its RA duty on day *d* (rationale: any student could be assigned at most once every day).
Connect every student to the sink with edges of capacity 2 (rationale: any day shall have at most 2 RA assigned).

Start with the lowest value of *x* possible - which is ceil(m / (n * 2)). Actually, starting with *x* = 1 is also an option and should not make any difference.
Compute the maximum flow; if the flow value is lower than n * 2 than increment *x* by one and repeat.
Otherwise you found an acceptable assignment.

## D - Lost In Translation

[Problem on Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems/lost)

[See solution](lost.cpp)

### Problem discussion

Build the weighted graph of languages and start a BFS from the root node (English).

For each vertex, register its parent language and the distance from English.
Whenever you find a cheapest connection with the same distance, or a connection with a lower distance, change the parent and update the distance.

Finally, print the sum of the verteces of the resulting treefind a cheapest connection with the same distance, or a connection with a lower distance, change the parent and update the distance.

Finally, print the sum of the verteces of the resulting tree.

## E - Aaah!

### Problem discussion

Compare the lengths of the two strings.
